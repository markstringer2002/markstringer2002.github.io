Where the count rounds to zero or data are deemed to be disclosive, any auxiliary variable i.e. employment or turnover  will be removed (..C). Where we remove a figure in a row or column, we must remove another in the same row and column to avoid disclosure by deduction, even in cases where the count may be large.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
