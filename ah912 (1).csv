,"Note: Count figures are control rounded to base five, so zeros may not necessarily be true zeroes. Where the count rounds to zero or data are deemed to be disclosive, any auxiliary variable i.e. employment or turnover  will be removed (..C). Where we remove a figure in a row or column, we must remove another in the same row and column to avoid disclosure by deduction, even in cases where the count may be large.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
